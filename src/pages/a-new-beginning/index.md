# Welcome to the party, pal

This is my new blog, where I'll be posting learnings and musings about software development and possibly life.

## What's this all about?

This blog is an opportunity to familiarize myself with the modern JavaScript ecosystem, including things like Gatsby, server-side rendering, GraphQL, and more.

## Thanks for coming

More content will arrive when I make time for it.
